%% ================ EJ1. Compute Cost (Feedforward) ================
%  To the neural network, you should first start by implementing the
%  feedforward part of the neural network that returns the cost only. You
%  should complete the code in nnCostFunction.m to return cost. After
%  implementing the feedforward to compute the cost, you can verify that
%  your implementation is correct by verifying that you get the same cost
%  as us for the fixed debugging parameters.
%
%  We suggest implementing the feedforward cost *without* regularization
%  first so that it will be easier for you to debug. Later, you
%  will get to implement the regularized cost.

         '\n(this value should be about 0.287629)\n'], J);

%% =============== EJ2. Implement Backpropagation ===============
%  You should proceed to implement the
%  backpropagation algorithm for the neural network. You should add to the
%  code you've written in nnCostFunction.m to return the partial
%  derivatives of the parameters.
%
fprintf('\nChecking Backpropagation... \n');

%  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
checkNNGradients;

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================ EJ3. Initializing Parameters ================
%  In this part of the exercise, you will be starting to implement a two
%  layer neural network that classifies digits. You will start by
%  implementing a function to initialize the weights of the neural network
%  (randInitializeWeights.m)

fprintf('\nInitializing Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

initial_Theta1 = randInitializeWeights(input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size);
initial_Theta2 = randInitializeWeights(hidden_layer_size, num_labels);

% Unroll parameters
initial_nn_params = [initial_Theta1(:) ; initial_Theta2(:)];


%% =================== EJ4. Training NN ===================
%  You have now implemented all the code necessary to train a neural 
%  network. To train your neural network, we will now use "fmincg", which
%  is a function which works similarly to "fminunc". Recall that these
%  advanced optimizers are able to train our cost functions efficiently as
%  long as we provide them with the gradient computations.
%
fprintf('\nTraining Neural Network... \n')

%  After you have completed the assignment, change the MaxIter to a larger
%  value to see how more training helps.



% Create "short hand" for the cost function to be minimized



% Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument (the
% neural network parameters)



% Obtain Theta1 and Theta2 back from nn_params



fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================= EJ5. Implement Predict =================
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.
